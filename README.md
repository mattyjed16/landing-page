# landing-page
Foundations project TOP

This is a project to set up an entire webpage from scratch using all the skills developed so far.
I should be able to set up the different elements of the index.html page first (with possible need to go back) before styling with css.
When styling, I should be able to use the skills from the the last few lessons, like flexbox, to create the webpage.
I will also use this page page to add any credits from images used in my page.
